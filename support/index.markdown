Banshee is a community project, so we rely on each other to be helpful and document problems and their solutions.  For Banshee to be able to grow and support a large number of users, it's important that we are clear, concise, and respectful of others and their time.

### FAQ

A list of frequently asked questions (and their answers).  To find your answer quickly and to respect others' time by not repeating common issues, it's a good idea to check if your issue is in the [FAQ](/support/faq).

### User Guide

We have created this [guide](/support/guide) to help you discover features and get the most from Banshee.  It includes information on using Banshee with your device, ripping and burning CDs, and keyboard shortcuts.

### Search for Information

If you need help, have a bug to report, or have an idea, it's important to search to see if your issue has been addressed before.

### Talk to Us!

We have both a mailing list/forum and real-time chat for [discussing Banshee and asking questions](/about/contact). The [forum](/support/forum) is actually the mailing list presented in a forum-like way.  If you have a problem, you should make sure you can't find it in the [FAQ](/support/faq), the [Guide](/support/guide), or by searching.  If the issue seems to be new, please feel free to ask!
