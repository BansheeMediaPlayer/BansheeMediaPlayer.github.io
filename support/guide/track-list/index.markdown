The track list is where your songs, videos, and podcasts are listed.

### List Columns

There are over 15 columns you can choose to show or hide.  Right click on a column header to get a menu where you can show or hide columns.

You can rearrange the order that columns are displayed in by dragging on the column header to the left or right.

### Sorting

You can sort by nearly any column simply by clicking on its header.  An arrow indicates the sort direction.  Click again to change the direction.  You can manually order any playlist or the _Play Queue_ by turning column sorting off and then dragging tracks to where you want them.  To turn column sorting off, click the sorted column header until the sort-direction arrow goes away.

### The Browser

The browser helps you narrow down the tracks displayed by selecting one or more groups or characteristics.  In your _Music Library_ you can browse by track Artist or Album, and in _Podcasts_ you can filter to only show new items, and browse by podcast.

### Adding Tracks to the Play Queue or Playlists

You can add tracks to a playlist by selecting and right clicking on them and choosing _Add to Play Queue_ or _Add to Playlist_.  A shortcut for adding the selected tracks to the _Play Queue_ is simply pressing `q`.  Additionally, you can drag tracks or even your browser selection (e.g. artists or albums) from the current list onto a playlist or the _Play Queue_.

### Multi-Artist (Compilation) Album Support

Since version 1.2 Banshee has had good support for multi-artist (compilation) albums.  If your files already contained album-artist metadata, Banshee should have picked that up and things should Just Work.  If not, you can always manually edit the _Album Artist_ by selecting the tracks of the album, pressing `e` to _Edit Information_, and setting a common value (e.g. "Various Artists" or the main artist on the album) in the Album Artist field.  When sorting by anything except Artist, your tracks will get sorted by Album Artist as you'd expect.
