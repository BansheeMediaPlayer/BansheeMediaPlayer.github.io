[Banshee 2.1.0](/download/archives/2.1.0/) has been released!
Banshee 2.1.0 is the first release in the 2.1 development series leading up to 2.2.  It brings a significant change in dependency policy.  We will be dropping legacy dependencies, and bump other deps to recent versions.  To support users on older distros, we'll publish a Linux bundle.  Read the [release notes](/download/archives/2.1.0/) for more info.
