A couple months ago it was decided that [Banshee would be the default player](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2010-November/msg00010.html) in Ubuntu 11.04, and in the last couple days [the technical switchover occurred](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/10/banshee-becomes-ubuntu-11-04-default-music-player/)!

Also, in the five months of August through December, Banshee users [earned the GNOME Foundation over $2,200 USD](/about/revenue/) via the integrated AmazonMP3 store!
