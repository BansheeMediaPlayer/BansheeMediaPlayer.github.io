Banshee 1.8 is just one week away!  Compared to [1.6](/download/archives/1.6.0/), it has some awesome advances.  You can help us polish and perfect it by testing the [1.7.6 release](/download/archives/1.7.6/) or [git master](/download/development/) and filing bugs, or by [translating it](/contribute/translate/) into your language.  Join us on our mailing list/forum or on IRC chat to [get in touch](/about/contact/)!
