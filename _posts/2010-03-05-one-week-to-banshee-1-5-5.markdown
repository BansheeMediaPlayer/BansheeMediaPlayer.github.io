Banshee 1.5.5, aka 1.6 RC 1, will be released Wednesday, March 10th.  Close on the heels of [1.5.4](/download/archives/1.5.4), it will mostly contain bug fixes, including a [common crasher in 1.5.4](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611128), faster searching of large libraries, and displaying a warning if syncing will remove lots of files from a device.
