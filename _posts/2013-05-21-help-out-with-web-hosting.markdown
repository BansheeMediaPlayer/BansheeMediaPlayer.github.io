title: Help out with Banshee's web hosting
---

For more than 2 years now, [Aaron Bockover](http://abock.org), the creator of Banshee, has been paying the costs of our web hosting (Linode server and domain names). This amounts to a bit over $500 per year.

We're currently looking for a better long term solution for our website, but it's going to take some time. Until then, we're kindly asking to consider [donating a few dollars](http://www.gofundme.com/banshee), to help him cover the costs for the current year.

This is not only a quick and easy way to help out, but it is also a great way to show Aaron our gratitude for creating Banshee, and for all his work during all those years.

As a token of our appreciation, the names of the donors will be displayed [on our website](/contribute/donate).

So go to [http://www.gofundme.com/banshee](http://www.gofundme.com/banshee) and show your love !
