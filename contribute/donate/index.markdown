For more than 2 years now, [Aaron Bockover](http://abock.org), the creator of Banshee, has been paying the costs of our web hosting (Linode server and domain names). This amounts to a bit over $500 per year.

We're currently looking for a better long term solution for our website, but it's going to take some time. Until then, we're kindly asking to consider [donating a few dollars](http://www.gofundme.com/banshee), to help him cover the costs for the current year.

We welcome donations from both organizations and individuals. Donate directly to Aaron through through [http://www.gofundme.com/banshee](http://www.gofundme.com/banshee)
