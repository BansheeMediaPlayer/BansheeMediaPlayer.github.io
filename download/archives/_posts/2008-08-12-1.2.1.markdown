Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the [Banshee repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Banshee/) to your repository list.





Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds. Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.






### No Conflicts





This new release is not backwards compatible with versions of Banshee before 1.0, however, it _will not_ conflict or cause any problems with any previous release you may have installed. If a Banshee library is located from a previous release, it will be _copied_ and _migrated_ to work with the new version.

Previously, all paths and packaging used the `banshee` project name. We are now using the `banshee-1` project name to avoid any packaging, installation, or user-data conflicts with previous releases of Banshee. For instance, the following file/data related things have changed:






  
  * Packaging/Installation
    
      
    * Installation path changed from `$(prefix)/lib/banshee` to `$(prefix)/lib/banshee-1`

      
    * Application launcher changed from `$(prefix)/bin/banshee` to `$(prefix)/bin/banshee-1`

      
    * Application icon name changed from `music-player-banshee` to `media-player-banshee`

      
    * DBus service changed from `org.gnome.Banshee` to `org.bansheeproject.Banshee`

    
  

  
  * User Data Access
    
      
    * GConf Root Key changed from `/apps/banshee` to `/apps/banshee-1`

      
    * Application data directory changed from `~/.config/banshee` to `~/.config/banshee-1` (note, the `~/.config` base directory depends on XDG settings for the user)

    
  





These changes mean you can have installed and use both older Banshee releases (0.13.2 and older) and new Banshee releases (0.98.1 and newer) without worrying about packaging or installation problems or user data conflicts. Keep in mind however, that this release is not backwards compatible with older releases. If library changes are made in this new release, they will not be reflected if you run an older release.
