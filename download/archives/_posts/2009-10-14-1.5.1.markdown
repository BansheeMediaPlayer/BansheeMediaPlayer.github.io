Banshee 1.5.1 is a stable release, with tons of bug fixes and new features.  It is the result of four and a half months work by more than 50 contributors.

### New Features

#### New Shuffle Modes

Shuffle by artist or album let you listen to everything by an artist or on an album before jumping to a new random artist or album.

Shuffle by rating or score lets you shuffle through your songs, with higher rated or scored tracks being more likely to play.

Alexander blogged [more about this feature](http://versia.com/2009/09/21/new-shuffle-modes-in-banshee/).

#### Auto DJ

This new feature gives you the option to keep your Play Queue filled with endless music.  It builds on the shuffle modes work, letting you fill the queue randomly in artist, album, song, rating, or score mode.
