Banshee 1.5.4 is a beta release, with several new features and lots of bug fixes, with contributions from 15 people.


### New Features





#### Opt-In Usage Data Collection

Under Preferences, you can choose to "Improve Banshee by sending
anonymous usage data" back to the Banshee developers.  This collects
information on what version you're running, what OS, library size,
slow SQL queries, and a whitelisted subset of your preferences. This
information will help us choose better defaults and see what parts of
Banshee are used most and can be improved.  All collected data is anonymous!


  




#### Default Equalizer Presets

Banshee now ships with several equalizer presets, and the core of the equalizer management has seen much internal improvement.


  




#### Banshee Community Extensions

A new sub-project named [Banshee Community Extensions](/download/extensions) has been
created.  Its code is hosted on [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/banshee-community-extensions), and its bugs tracked
alongside Banshee's.  It already contains 9 extensions, including
Alarm Clock, Lyrics, and Mirage, and has 15 maintainers.  Its releases
track Banshee's.
  




#### Extensible Shuffle Modes

Extensions can now add new shuffle modes and PlayQueue fill-by
modes.  The Mirage extension is the first to take advantage of this,
adding a Shuffle/Fill-by Similar mode based on acoustical analysis.
