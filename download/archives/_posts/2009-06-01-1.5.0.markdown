With Banshee 1.5.0, you can autodetect the BPM of songs in your library, or you can manually set it by tapping the beat.  Then, you can sort, search, or make smart playlists based on BPM.
  

_Autodetection requires the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin, found in gst-plugins-bad_


  




#### Automatic Scoring

As you play songs in Banshee 1.5.0, it will automatically assign them scores (0 - 100) based on if/when you press skip.


  




#### Creative Commons





[![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.5.0/thumbs/license-column.png)](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.5.0/license-column.png)




A new column displays Creative Commons licensing info where applicable (and properly tagged).  The license can be edited in the track editor (see above).  There is also a new default Last.fm station for songs tagged 'Creative Commons'.


  




#### Separate Library Locations
