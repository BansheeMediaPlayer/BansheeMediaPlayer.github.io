Banshee 1.6 is a stable release, the culmination of a year's work.  There
are so many new features, bug fixes, and polish in this release, we won't
be able to do it all justice in these notes, but we'll try.  These notes
aggregate the highlights from the 1.5 series releases.

### New Features Since 1.4

#### Play Queue Auto DJ keeps the tunes coming

Keep your Play Queue filled with endless music, selected randomly
by artist, album, song, rating, or score mode.

Alexander blogged [more about this feature](http://versia.com/2009/09/23/updated-play-queue-in-banshee/).

#### Sync Device From Playlist Option

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-sync-from-playlist.png" alt="screenshot showing sync device from playlist options"></div>

Either manually manage what files are added/removed to your device,
or choose a playlist to sync from.  You can make a size-limited smart
playlist to sync just the right amount to your device.

####  Grid View

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.5/banshee-album-grid.png" alt="screenshot showing the album browser in grid mode"></div>

We are debuting a new grid mode for our custom list widget, visible
in the modified Album browser.  It will be used for Videos,
Audiobooks, and more in future releases.
<br clear="all">

#### Banshee Community Extensions

A new sub-project named Banshee Community Extensions has been
created.  Its code is hosted on Gitorious, and its bugs tracked
in bugzilla.gnome.org.  It already contains 15 extensions, including
Lyrics, Telepathy and Mirage, and has 19 maintainers.  Its releases
track Banshee's.  [More information.](http://banshee.fm/download/extensions/)

#### Type-ahead Find in Track, Artist, and Album Lists

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-typeahead-find.png" alt="screenshot showing typeahead find in the Banshee track list"></div>

An alternative to filtering, type-ahead find jumps you to the first
track to match your query.  Activate with shift+/, cancel with Esc,
and jump to next match with F3.  In track list it matches against
artist, album, or title.
<br clear="all">

#### Automatic Scoring

Songs now have scores, updated as you play and skip.  The score
can be used in searches and smart playlists, and serve as a basis
for ratings.

#### New Shuffle Modes

Shuffle by artist or album let you listen to everything by an artist or on an album before jumping to a new random artist or album.

Shuffle by rating or score lets you shuffle through your songs, with higher rated or scored tracks being more likely to play.

Alexander blogged [more about this feature](http://versia.com/2009/09/21/new-shuffle-modes-in-banshee/).

#### Audiobooks Library

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-audiobooks-pref.png" alt="screenshot showing the audiobooks extension listed in Preferences"></div>

Rough first version, main benefits are separating your books from
your music and defining a different file system organization.  In
future versions we plan to add intuitive bookmarking and a better
browsing experience.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.
<br clear="all">

#### Library-folder Watcher

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-library-watcher.png" alt="screenshot showing Library Watcher extension listed in Preferences "></div>

Watches your libraries' folders for added, renamed, or deleted
files, and updates your libraries appropriately.  Requires
Mono >= 2.4.3.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.
<br clear="all">

#### eMusic Importer/Downloader

<div class="release-shot right"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-emusic.png" alt="screenshot showing eMusic extension in the Import Media dialog"></div>

If you have purchased music from eMusic and have a .emx file, Banshee
will download and import the music files for you.  Select
'eMusic Files' from the normal Media > Import Media dialog. Enable
in Extensions tab of Preferences.
<br clear="all">

#### GIO File Backend, Supports Non-local Files

This backend uses the GIO library to support importing local files
and network-share files alike.  Requires glib >= 2.22 and Gio#.

#### Internet Archive extension

Search and stream content from the Internet Archive's vast store of
media, including 70,000 concerts and 200,000 videos.  Enable it in
the Extensions tab of the Preferences dialog.

####  YouTube Extension

This extension shows YouTube videos in the Context Pane related to
what you're playing, and lets you watch them within Banshee.  You
can enable it in the Extensions tab of the Preferences dialog.

<div class="release-shot"><img src="/images/shots/1.5.5/banshee-youtube.png" alt="screenshot showing thumbnails of YouTube videos related to the playing song"></div>
<br clear="all">

#### Improved Metadata Handling

Banshee is now able to read and write rating and playcount
information contained in your media files. Enable this option
in Preferences.

Searching and smart playlists use unicode-aware case-insensitive
search; i.e. n matches Ã± and vice-versa, and similarly smart sorting.

Artist/album/track sort fields are now supported, the License URI
field is now exposed and Creative Commons aware, and the BPM field
is exposed with an option to calculate it for all songs.
