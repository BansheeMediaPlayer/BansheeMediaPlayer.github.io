New to Banshee 1.4 is automatic library synchronization. Of course you can also continue to manually manage content on your portable device. Additionally, playlists are now supported on media devices, including MTP/PlaysForSure and iPod devices, and even mass storage devices, if configured correctly. You can even configure cover art support for your mass storage device now!


  




#### Support for HTC Android G1

The new HTC Android G1 phone (currently being offered by T-Mobile) is supported out of the box, including the ability to recognize and import music purchased from the Amazon MP3 store application on the G1. Cover art is also supported out of the box.


  




#### First Preview of Mac OS X Support




[![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/thumbs/osx.png)](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/osx.png)




For the first time, Banshee is now available on Mac OS X. This is a beta-quality technology preview for OS X since there are known stability issues and full feature parity to the Linux releases has not yet been met, but we welcome your testing and feedback. Please [file any issues](/contribute/file-bugs/) you find. We intend to fully evolve and support the Mac OS X releases.




For installation instructions for Mac OS X, see our [download page](http://banshee-project.org/download/#osx).

#### Shiny Updates to Now Playing




[![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/thumbs/now-playing.png)](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/now-playing.png)




The _Now Playing_ source, where video is played, now includes a more appealing cover art and track information display featuring fading transitions. This display in Full Screen Mode is particularly appealing during parties and times when interacting with Banshee's management interface is undesirable.


  




#### New Track Editor




[![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/thumbs/track-editor-basic.png)](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/track-editor-basic.png)




Banshee 1.4 features a newly designed and rewritten track editor. The editor allows for easy editing of more advanced metadata details, and is more usable now for editing compilation (_"Various Artists"_) albums.

The editor also features easy keyboard navigation between tracks (try pressing `enter` or `ctrl+enter` in the _Title_ field) to facilitate quick editing of albums. Metadata common to an entire album can also be copied to all tracks in the album, further simplifying editing.




In addition, the editor is fully extensible, making it easy for developers to add new functionality with [just a few lines of code](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/banshee/trunk/banshee/src/Core/Banshee.ThickClient/Banshee.Gui.TrackEditor/ITrackEditorPage.cs).


  




#### Rescan Library Tool




![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/rescan-library.png)




A new tool was added that will rescan your media collection on disk. It will remove files from your library that no longer exist, and add new ones that may have shown up since your last import.




Banshee 1.6 will feature a collection monitoring feature that can perform these housekeeping measures automatically, but in the mean time this tool is one click away.


  




#### Automatically Update File Names




![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/update-file-names.png)




To help with keeping your media collection on disk named in a consistent and appealing way, Banshee can now automatically fix paths/file names when changes are made to metadata.




This feature can be enabled through the _Preferences_ dialog.


  




#### Split Columns Menu




![](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.4.1/thumbs/split-columns-menu.png)




Banshee can be configured to display a number of columns in its track list. By default only a few common ones are chosen, but columns can be added or removed by right clicking on any column in the track list.




While this is not new, the menu was split to make it easier to choose which columns you'd like to see. In other media applications, this list often scrolls off the screen.




We think this is just a small example of how attention to detail helps create an enjoyable end user experience.
