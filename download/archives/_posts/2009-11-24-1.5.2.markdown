Banshee 1.5.2 is a beta release, with several new features and lots of bug fixes, with contributions from 22 people.



### New Features



    

#### iTunes importer


    

Import your iTunes library, including ratings and playcounts.



    

#### Rating and Playcount Metadata


    

Banshee is now able to read and write rating and playcount information contained in your media files.  Enable this option in Preferences.



    

#### New Devices Supported


    

Support for Pulse and Droid phones has been added.  Also, recognize Samsung Galaxy and Palm Pre devices in debug mode.




    

#### Use new Last.fm 2.0 API


    

Subscribers will once again be able to stream music from Last.fm.  Unfortunately, Last.fm has changed its policies (and started enforcing them with the 2.0 API) such that non-subscribers cannot stream music via third party applications, including Banshee.



    

#### Internet Archive Source


    

This new extension adds support for searching and streaming content from the Internet Archive's vast store of media, including 70,000 concerts and 200,000 movies.  Enable this extension in Preferences.



    

#### Many Accessibility Improvements


    

Many months of effort went into the accessibility (a11y) improvements now released in Banshee 1.5.2.  From better focus handling, to button naming, to implementing full a11y for our custom ListView widget, Banshee should now be fully accessible.


    

Note that to get a11y support for Banshee's custom widgets, you will need Gtk# 2.12 from svn trunk, though we are told a new release is coming soon.


    

Eitan Isaacson [blogged more about the a11y effort](http://monotonous.org/category/accessibility/) on his blog.
