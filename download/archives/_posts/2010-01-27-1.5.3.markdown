Banshee 1.5.3 is a beta release, with several new features and lots of bug fixes, with contributions from 16 people.


### New Features




#### Sync Device From Playlist Option




![screenshot showing sync device from playlist options](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-sync-from-playlist.png)




Either manually manage what files are added/removed to your device,
or choose a playlist to sync from.  You can make a size-limited smart
playlist to sync just the right amount to your device.


  




#### Type-ahead Find in Track, Artist, and Album Lists




![screenshot showing typeahead find in the Banshee track list](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-typeahead-find.png)




An alternative to filtering, type-ahead find jumps you to the first
track to match your query.  Activate with shift+/, cancel with Esc,
and jump to next match with F3.  In track list it matches against
artist, album, or title.





#### Optional Cover Art in Lower-left Corner

Turn on via View > Show Cover Art

and beside the seek-slider.


  




#### Audiobooks Library

Rough first version, main benefits are separating your books from
your music and defining a different file system organization.  In
future versions we plan to add intuitive bookmarking and a better
browsing experience.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.





#### Library-folder Watcher

Watches your libraries' folders for added, renamed, or deleted
files, and updates your libraries appropriately.  Requires
Mono >= 2.4.3.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.


  




#### eMusic Importer/Downloader




![screenshot showing eMusic extension in the Import Media dialog](http://download.banshee-project.org/shots/1.5.3/banshee-1.5.3-emusic.png)




If you have purchased music from eMusic and have a .emx file, Banshee
will download and import the music files for you.  Select
'eMusic Files' from the normal Media > Import Media dialog. Enable
in Extensions tab of Preferences.


  




#### GIO File Backend, Supports Non-local Files




This backend uses the GIO library to support importing local files
and network-share files alike.  Requires glib >= 2.22 and Gio#.
