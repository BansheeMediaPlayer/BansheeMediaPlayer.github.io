Our release schedule is aligned with GNOME's.  Releases with an odd middle number (eg 2.1.x) are development releases leading up to a semi-annual stable release (eg 2.2.x).  Development releases are developed on our [git master](/download/development) branch and can progress rapidly.  Stable releases are maintained in a bug-fix only manner for a year or so in separate branches (eg stable-2.0).
