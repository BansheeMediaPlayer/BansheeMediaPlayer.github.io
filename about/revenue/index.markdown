Since July 2010 Banshee has had [Amazon MP3 Store integration](http://integrated-services.banshee.fm/amz/redirect.do/geo/home/).  Amazon pays an affiliate fee for purchases (10% of MP3s, less for other items), all of which goes to the non-profit [GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/), except on distributions that patch our code: Ubuntu, where Canonical takes a 75% cut, and Linux Mint, where they keep 50%.

As of September 1, 2011 Banshee has raised $9,215 USD for the GNOME Foundation!  We're on pace to contribute over $10,000 USD per year to GNOME, which is around 3% of the Foundation's budget.  We are keeping a [monthly breakdown](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AlEOoO4Ozn9IdFRjRUdYWndTekotQnc1Q3pIU1hEQ0E&hl=en) in a spreadsheet.

By purchasing music through Banshee's integrated Amazon MP3 Store, you not only get seamless downloading, you support our free software community.

Go to the [Amazon MP3 Store](http://integrated-services.banshee.fm/amz/redirect.do/geo/home/) and support GNOME and Banshee!
