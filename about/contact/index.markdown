We use two main ways of communicating with each other: a mailing-list/forum and a chatroom in IRC.  If you have found a bug, you can ask in the chatroom or on the list/forum about it, but it really belongs in [our bug tracker](/contribute/file-bugs).

### Mailing List/Forum

We use a [mailing list](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/banshee-list) for discussing Banshee, getting help from each other, etc.

<form method="post" action="https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/subscribe/banshee-list">
  <p>
    <strong>Subscribe to banshee-list:</strong><br />
    <input type="text" name="email" size="30" value="your e-mail address" onclick="this.select();" /><input type="submit" name="email-button" value="Subscribe" />
  </p>
</form>

  * [View or Post to List via Forum Interface](/support/forum)

### Chat

We also use an IRC chat room for real-time discussions.  Join us in [_#banshee_](irc://irc.gnome.org/#banshee) on _irc.gnome.org_.  If you have a question, ask straight away, and if somebody is available they will answer.  You can use Pidgin, XChat, or many other clients to access the chatroom.

### Press Inquiries

Interested in interviewing a Banshee maintainer or having them speak at your LUG, conference, or other event? [Contact us](http://git.gnome.org/browse/banshee/tree/MAINTAINERS).
